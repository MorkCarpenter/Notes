# A
## Problem Statement
There are *N* people. Each of them agrees or disagrees with a proposal. Here, *N* is an odd number.

The i-th (i=1,2,…,N) person's opinion is represented by a string $S_i$ : the person agrees if $S_i$ = For and disagrees if $S_i$ = Against.

Determine whether the majority agrees with the proposal.

## Constraints

- *N* is an odd number between 1 and 99,inclusive.
- $S_i$ = For or $S_i$ = Against, for all i=1,2,…,N.

## cpp
```cpp
#include<stdio.h>
char c[10];
int n,x;
int main(){
	scanf("%d",&n);
	for(int i=1;i<=n;++i)
        scanf("%s",c+1),(c[1]=='F'?++x:--x);
	if(x<0) printf("No");
	else printf("Yes");
    return 0;
}
